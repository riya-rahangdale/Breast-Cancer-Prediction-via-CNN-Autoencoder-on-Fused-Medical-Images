This project focuses on enhancing breast cancer prediction by fusing mammographic and histopathological images using a deep learning approach. By combining the structural insights from mammograms with cellular-level details from histopathology images, the model gains a comprehensive view of cancerous patterns. An autoencoder is used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, while a multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes these features at various levels to improve classification accuracy. This fusion-based method outperforms traditional single-modality approaches, offering a robust and efficient tool for early breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
